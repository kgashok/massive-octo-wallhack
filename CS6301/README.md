### World-class Lab Environment
1. Eclipse - a industry strength IDE
2. Google Unit Testing Framework
  - Why TDD? Test Driven Development http://buff.ly/1xbPnx5 
  - Why Google's framework and not something else? [FAQ](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/FAQ#Why_should_I_use_Google_Test_instead_of_my_favorite_C++_testing)
    - Why not? "gtest - Google Test is Chromium's C++ test harness." http://buff.ly/1nVqBYp 
3. `Git` - for version control and opportunities for **mentors** (_far and near, and the world over_) to give you expert advice. 


### How to set up?
The first one is a good description of how to go about it, systematically. 
- C++ unit test start guide, how to set up Google Test (gtest) in Eclipse? - CodeProject http://buff.ly/1qmkiBQ 
If you prefer to follow through visually (I prefer this), this should help: 
- A 8 minute video - Setup Eclipse with Google Test - YouTube http://buff.ly/1oAYFII 

### Advanced
- Dr Fraser's video is excellent. Worth following through, but be ready to spend time on this. 
   "Creating a Repository: Git & Eclipse" - YouTube http://buff.ly/1oB25Lv 
- Eclipse - Git - Quick how tos. - YouTube http://buff.ly/1CpC0tj

### Improvement Ideas?
I shall capture all of it one [place](doc/TODO.md)

### Structure of Project
Here's a map of the files in this project, and pretty much self-explanatory. There are four components for which unit test cases have been generated.
Clean separation between interface files and implementation files has been established.
