### World-class Lab Environment
1. Eclipse - a industry strength IDE
2. Google Unit Testing Framework
3. `Git` - for version control and opportunities for **mentors** (_far and near, and the world over_) to give you expert advice. 

### How to set up?

Clean separation between interface files and implementation files has been established.
